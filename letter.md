## Anniversary Letter

<b>To the love of my life, Yasi</b>

Happy anniversary, my baby bug!! <33

I want you to know, from the depths of my heart, that you truly mean <i>everything</i> to me. You've been the best friend I've always wanted, and your company brings me so much warmth and joy. I wish there was a way for me to express just how amazing you make me feel, but I'm just a little guy, it's hard to convey all these beautiful emotions you give me. But I want you to know this: you're absolutely amazing, Yasi. I admire you more than words can say. I wish you could see yourself the way I do.

There's a saying I love:
> "How you do anything is how you do everything."

I think it's so true. Before I met you, I hadn't experienced anything close to the love you’ve shown me. My approach to life used to be more reserved, but since you came into my world, you've made every single day happier. Because of you, I find joy in all the little things. I approach everything with more enthusiasm, more hope, more <i>worth</i>. You make me feel cared for in a way I never knew I needed, and because of that, I’ve felt more alive. You inspire me to pursue things I've always wanted to try, such as building websites, publishing my obsidian notes, diving into game development, or even back to badminton. All this passion, all this excitement, it's fueled by the happiness you've brought into my life. I owe you so much, Yasi.

I also know life’s been throwing a lot at you lately. You’ve been feeling low, uncertain, and overwhelmed at times, and I’m so sorry things have been tough. I want to be there for you through it all. I’ve poured my heart into this little website so that you can always feel my love, even when words fall short. Of course, no website could ever truly capture all my feelings I feel for you, but I hope it brings a smile to your face. I want you, Yasi – more than words, numbers, or even googolplex plus one could express. No matter what life throws our way, no matter how tough things might get or what difficult conversations we'll have, I’ll never give up on us. You’re stuck with me, my love, mwehehehehehehe.

And you, Yasi… you are so <i>adorable</i>. Nothing in the world could replace your smile. I love the way your nose feels when I poke that little George bump on it. I love how your pupils get so big when you look at me with those deep, soulful eyes. I love your cute little cheeks and how they extrude (3D joke), I love your style, how you move, how you <i>are</i>. And it's so cute how you ask me not to look at you while you change, it's the cutest thing ever. I even love when in the middle of the night, you have to grab at me because of your Reynold’s, pulling yourself closer as you sleep. Your warmth, your touch—it’s all so comforting. 

I love how you treat animals, how you treat my family. You’re so kind, so caring, and it’s just one more reason I adore you. And, of course, I have to mention, you have the most beautiful topology I’ve ever seen. All the right polygons in all the right places. *Winks.*

I hope you like the website, I love you baby <3

Ryan

### Soooo wuts on the website
So I thought to put a few things on the website,

1. Firstly, I created a <a href="https://ryancranie.com/yasi/">recollection</a>, I put some of our earliest memories on here, and I hope we can walk through them together! :)
2. Secondly, I gave you some extra <a href="https://ryancranie.com/yasi/flowers">flowers</a>, just click the button and you'll see more! Still though, this is simply not enough flowers for my baby.
3. Thirdly, I created a <a href="https://ryancranie.com/yasi/jokes">jokes page</a>; I figured we laughed a lot at those dumb dad jokes so I wanted us to joke about some more.
4. And lastly, I created a simple <a href="https://ryancranie.com/yasi/album">album</a>. I was exclusive and chose some of my favourite pictures of us to put here.

### Our Time Together
Here shows how much time we have been together!!

<p id="together-time">
  <strong>Days:</strong> <span id="days"></span><br>
  <strong>Hours:</strong> <span id="hours"></span><br>
  <strong>Minutes:</strong> <span id="minutes"></span><br>

<script>
  // Set the date you started dating (year, month-1, day)
  const startDate = new Date(2023, 9, 20);

  function updateCountdown() {
    const now = new Date();
    const diff = now - startDate;
    
    const seconds = Math.floor(diff / 1000);
    const minutes = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
    const hours = Math.floor(minutes / 60);
    const days = Math.floor(hours / 24);

    // Update HTML elements with the calculated time
    document.getElementById('days').textContent = days;
    document.getElementById('hours').textContent = hours;
    document.getElementById('minutes').textContent = minutes;
    document.getElementById('seconds').textContent = seconds;
  }

  // Update the countdown every second
  setInterval(updateCountdown, 1000);
