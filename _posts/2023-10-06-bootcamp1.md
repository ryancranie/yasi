title: The Bootcamp

On the <b>6th October</b>, you sat besides me in the train station. I remember how chuffed I was when you did that, you made so easy to tap your shoulder and say hello :). Weird coincidence though fr.

I loved you for a long time, and as stated before I was thinking about you often prior to the bootcamp (in a nonchalant way)... i knew I wanted to hang with you again at Loughborough.

We proceeded to have an <b>amazing time</b> at this bootcamp, despite the fact we were in split groups, we spent as much time together as we could've.

We did so much, we walked so much, we hung out so much.

wow, that's a weird question fr. I pryed open that rusty vaseline to save your crusty dusty lips, like the gentleman I am and strive to be.

These beds stunk of piss.

<b>Some other highlights:</b>

* when we sat outside on that bench on the first night
* when we hung out at the bench with Nathan and Max
* the banana and that poor slug
* when we sat at the first campfire and I grabbed you
* when we sat at the next campfire, alone

By the end of the bootcamp, it was late, we were at buchanan, waiting on my bus. I was convinced I would "never be seeing you again", kind of realising how I'd fold shortly after the bootcamp, how silly of me.

We were sat down, just talking, and I started to cry, you remember? I couldn't help it. Although I didn't accept how I felt at the time, I knew how hard it would be to not have you around.

Completely in denial, completely in love. I said goodbye to you, you told me you'd miss me. I remember this vividly, you said how you would really miss me. Nobody had ever spoke to me like the way you did. Well, I missed you too, I would end up missing you a lot.

We missed each other <b>sooo much</b> in fact, we would send hundreds of messages between bootcamp, and the next time I would see you, which wouldn't be too far away...
